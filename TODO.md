# TODO

### Voxelization

- [ ] Implement a simple renderer
- [ ] Re-enable the original voxelizer
- [ ] Implement the debug rendering for voxels (maybe compute shader?)
- [ ] Finish improvements to serialization and document the serialization format
- [ ] Check if normal calculation issues are still present
- [ ] If time allows multithread voxelization and do other optimisations

### Physics-sim

- [ ] Should get the previous code working
- [ ] Consider replacing it with something else with better documentation
- [ ] Look into the possibility of getting it running on gpu at some point
  - Most likely only going to happen if the library I end up using supports it out of the box
